# CSCI440-FA21-Project2
Project 2 in Winthrop's Computer Graphics Course: 3D Objects.

Please implement a program to create and display 2 different 3D objects.  Your objects must have at least 12 different surfaces.  Provide a three sliders to allow me to rotate the scene around any axis.  In later projects, you will be expanding this to improve interactivity, lighting, and texture to your objects, so make them complex enough to be interesting for later projects (e.g., simple spaceship, robot, etc.).  

Please add your JavaScript *and* HTML code to this repository -- as well as any other files that I will need to run your program.  Make sure you commit and push *often*.  I will grade whatever is in the repo at the datetime stamp of the due date for the assignment.

## A Few Notes

* A single surface will likely be made up of multiple triangles, so your objects will have a lot of vertices.
* I have access to your repository, as well, so the easiest way for me to help you while you work on this is to commit and push before asking your question so I can see your most recent code.
* Start simple and build up; use the examples.
